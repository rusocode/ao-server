AO-Server is a server written in Java for the game Argentum Online, an MMORPG developed in 1999 using Visual Basic 6.

The server's goal is to leverage multithreading and the features offered by Java (APIs, libraries and frameworks) to
improve game performance.

AO-Server is currently based on AOXP-Server
in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aoxp/AOXP-Server/commit/daa8d10b83b762a0072dd022e99fdfab1c57bb6b">this
commit</a> because the original implementation is static now.
